# MageZero Setup Guide

This guide walks you through installing MageZero and training your first deck-local RL agent.

If you just want to run a trained model against your own deck in XMage, see the Play section at the bottom. This guide assumes you're here to train.

---

## 1. System Requirements

### Hardware

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 4 cores | 8–16 cores |
| RAM | 16 GB | 32–64 GB |
| GPU | — | NVIDIA, 8 GB+ VRAM |
| Disk | 25 GB free | 40 GB+ |

MCTS is CPU-heavy. Training uses the GPU. Both can run on one machine.

### Software

- Windows or Linux (Windows tested, Linux support in progress)
- Java 21+
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch with CUDA ([install guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/))
- Git

## 2. Install MageZero

### 2.1 Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/WillWroble/MageZero
cd MageZero
```

### 2.2 Download the XMage distribution

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/WillWroble/MageZero/releases/latest) and download `magezero-xmage-v0.1.0-alpha.zip`. Extract it into the repo root so you end up with an `xmage/` folder containing `lib/`, `mz-xmage.bat`, `mz-xmage.sh`, and `log4j.properties`.

```
MageZero/
├── xmage/          ← from the release zip
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── mz-xmage.bat
│   ├── mz-xmage.sh
│   └── log4j.properties
├── src/
├── configs/
└── ...
```

You do not need to clone or build XMage from source. The release ships a precompiled JAR with all dependencies bundled.

### 2.3 Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2.4 Install MageZero

```
pip install -e .
```

This installs the `mz` command globally in your venv and pulls all Python dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

Verify it worked:
```
mz --help
```

You should see the list of subcommands: `train`, `batch`, `play`, `import`, `export`.

### 2.5 GPU check

```
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Should print `True`. If `False`, install the CUDA-matched PyTorch wheel from the link above — the default pip install often gives you the CPU-only build.

---

## 3. Add a Deck

Training is deck-local. You need at least one deck to train and one or more decks for your agent to train against.

### 3.1 Convert your deck to .dck format

Export your deck from Moxfield, MTGA, or MTGO as plain text. Use the XMage client's deck builder (or any `.txt` → `.dck` converter) to produce a `.dck` file.

Sideboards are not yet supported.

### 3.2 Drop it in

```
MageZero/xmage/decks/MyDeck.dck
```

The filename (without `.dck`) is what you'll reference everywhere else — in configs, on the command line, in the data/model folder names. Pick something without spaces.

A handful of reference decks are included in `xmage/decks/` out of the box for opponents — monocolored Standard decks. You can add your own or use those.

---

## 4. Configure Your Run

Open `configs/run.yml`. This is the main file you'll edit.

```yaml
deck: MyDeck
version: 1
start_from_version: null

generations: 6
games_per_gen: 200
replay_buffer_gens: 3

opponents:
  - deck: Standard-MonoR
    mode: minimax
  - deck: Standard-MonoG
    mode: minimax

training:
  analyze_dataset: true
  generate_plots: true
  eval_previous_model: true

log_level: ACTIONS
curriculum: configs/curriculum.yml
```

Fields worth knowing:

- **`deck`** — the deck you're training. Must match a file at `xmage/decks/<deck>.dck`.
- **`version`** — the version number for this training run. Defaults to 1. Increment if you want to start fresh without overwriting a previous run's models and data.
- **`start_from_version`** — set to a previous version number to start training from that checkpoint instead of offline bootstrap. Leave as `null` for a first-time run.
- **`generations`** — how many full self-play / train / eval cycles to run.
- **`games_per_gen`** — how many games per opponent per generation.
- **`replay_buffer_gens`** — how many past generations of data to train on. Older data gets archived automatically.
- **`opponents`** — list of decks to play against. `mode` is `minimax` (fast, heuristic bot) or `mcts` (full MCTS with its own trained model). Start with `minimax` for initial training.

### Curriculum (optional)

`configs/curriculum.yml` controls hyperparameter annealing across generations. The defaults are reasonable — you don't need to touch this unless you want to tune the schedule. See comments in the file for details.

### Game parameters (optional)

`configs/game.yml` controls XMage-side parameters the runner passes through (search budget, threads, MCTS timeout, hidden info toggle, etc.). Edit if you want to tweak the engine, but the defaults work.

---

## 5. Train

```
mz train
```

That's the whole command. `mz train` will:

1. Create a run folder under `runs/<timestamp>/`
2. For each generation:
   - Launch the primary Python inference server (or run offline for gen 0)
   - For each opponent: start/stop its server if needed, launch XMage via the JAR, generate games
   - Run dataset stats on the new data (saves plots)
   - Evaluate the previous generation's model on the new data (gen 1+)
   - Move new data from `testing/` to `training/`
   - Archive out-of-window training data
   - Train the next model (50 epochs bootstrap, 10 epochs from checkpoint)
3. Mark the run as complete

The terminal shows XMage game logs in real time. Python-side output (training loss, dataset stats, test accuracy) is captured in per-run log files instead of flooding your terminal.

### Resume an interrupted run

If `mz train` is interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash, power outage), the next time you run it it'll detect the incomplete run and ask:

```
Active run found: 2026-04-09_14-23-42. Resume? [Y/n]
```

Answer `Y` to pick up where you left off. Answer `n` to abandon it and start fresh — the abandoned run is marked in its `run.json` but never deleted, so the history is preserved.

### What gets produced

```
data/MyDeck/ver1/
├── testing/                 ← new data arrives here first
├── training/                ← active training buffer
└── archive/                 ← out-of-window data

models/MyDeck/ver1/
├── model.pt.gz              ← latest checkpoint
├── ignore.roar              ← feature ignore list
└── state.json               ← deck session counter

plots/MyDeck/ver1/
├── value_hist_*.png
├── avg_policy_*.png
└── idx_dist_*.png

runs/2026-04-09_14-23-42/
├── run.json                 ← full run history
├── train.log                ← all gens, appended
├── test.log
├── dataset_stats.log
└── server_50052.log
```

Every run is fully self-contained under `runs/`. You can grep across a run's full training history with `grep foo runs/2026-04-09_14-23-42/train.log`.

---

## 6. Monitor a Run

Training can take hours. Watch progress live from another terminal:

```
# Tail the training output
Get-Content runs\<run_id>\train.log -Wait -Tail 20

# Watch data files appear
dir data\MyDeck\ver1\testing
```

The `run.json` file is updated after every gen with the current stage (`generate`, `analyze`, `eval`, `move`, `train`) — check it to see what the runner is doing right now.

---

## 7. Other Commands

### `mz batch`
Launch a single XMage data generation run using `configs/game.yml` directly. No orchestration, no training — just XMage. Useful for manual experiments outside the curriculum pipeline.

```
mz batch --config configs/game.yml
```

### `mz import <file>`
Auto-detects file type:
- `.dck` → copies to `xmage/decks/`
- `.mz` → unpacks to `models/<deck>/ver<N>/`
- `.txt` → not yet wired up, convert manually for now

```
mz import path/to/mydeck.dck
```

### `mz export`
Pack a trained model into a shareable `.mz` bundle.

```
mz export --deck MyDeck --version 3
```

Produces `exports/MyDeck_v3.mz` containing the model, ignore list, and metadata.

### `mz play` (stub)
Host a local AI player for the XMage client to connect to. Not yet implemented.

## 8. Troubleshooting

**`mz train` hangs at "Loading database..."** — First launch builds the H2 card database from scratch. Takes ~1 minute. Subsequent runs skip this.

**`HDF5FileNotFoundException: Directory does not exist`** — The runner creates parent directories automatically, but `mz batch` with a custom `output_file` does not. Create the parent folder manually or use `mz train` instead.

**`Failed to establish connection to network model`** — The Java side couldn't reach the Python server. Check that `server_50052.log` in your run folder shows the server started successfully. If the server failed, runner would have aborted — so this warning is usually benign and means the JVM launched before the server was fully ready. Not a problem, servers have a 600s warmup window.

**`java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`** — Lower `games_per_gen` or reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT_GAMES` in the XMage source. Default heap is `-Xmx24g` in `mz-xmage.bat`; bump it up if you have more RAM.

**Couldn't load deck, deck size=0** — Card set jar missing or corrupt. Redownload the XMage distribution zip from the release page and re-extract.

**ZGC not supported** — Edit `xmage/mz-xmage.bat` and remove `-XX:+UseZGC`. G1GC (the default) will be used instead, slightly slower but works everywhere.
